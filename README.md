# MSS TimeClock App

This browser-based time clock helps track time spent on projects or client work. Users can log time manually or in real-time and organize entries using customizable organizations, categories, and subcategories. Flexible rate settings at global, organization, or category levels enable accurate earnings calculations, with statistics showing daily and monthly income. Users can create profiles, invite others to join organizations, and set daily goals with a built-in goal tracker. Categories and subcategories can be hidden when no longer needed. Designed for seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices.
